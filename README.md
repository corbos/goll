# Goll

Learning both Rust and the Roguelike genre.

## Goals in Priority Order
1. Learn Rust tools.
2. Write idiomatic Rust.
3. No fancy UI, command line only
4. Create a serviceable Roguelike.
5. Make it platform-independent.
6. Few dependencies.

## Challenges

`termion` doesn't support Windows, except maybe in an unofficial branch/fork. 

`rustbox` doesn't build on Windows on the first go. Seems like maybe it could work with a little nudge (relies on `termbox`), but I'm not sure how much time I want to put into it. All in all, a little disappointed with Rust's cross-platform CLI.
