# Goll

Learning both Rust and the Roguelike genre.

## Goals in Priority Order
1. Learn Rust tools.
2. Write idiomatic Rust.
3. No fancy UI, command line only
4. Create a serviceable Roguelike.
5. Make it platform-independent.
6. Few dependencies.

## Challenges

~~`termion`~~ doesn't support Windows, except maybe in an unofficial branch/fork. 

~~`rustbox`~~ doesn't support Windows since it relies on `termbox`.

`crossterm` is fairly complicated for what it does, but _is_ cross-platform.
